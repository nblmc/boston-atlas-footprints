Prior to the [Atlascope project](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), LMEC @ BPL created spatial indices for their Boston urban atlas holdings.

The majority of the indices have been superceded by new [Atlascope data](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/documentation/atlas-data.html), which conform to data standards specific to the Atlascope project, but there are a number of Boston area BPL-held urban atlases which are not made available via Atlascope, due to copyright restrictions.

We are preserving access to these original spatial indices for those atlases still under copyright, in order to support research inquiries. This repository contains those files. You can gain a comprehensive understanding of our physical and geospatial atlas holdings by visiting our [Urban Atlas Research Guides](https://guides.bpl.org/urban-atlases)
